Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description - 
A “Hidden Markov model” is a mathematical model 
which has been implemented as algorithm for 
detecting the credit card fraud detection. This 
algorithm is implemented in JAVA. This algorithm 
will calculate a threshold value based on the usage 
of a user and determine whether it is a fraud or not. 
For every transaction OTP will be generated and 
send to the user email-id and registered mobile number. 
If a transaction is detected has fraud, the particular 
card will be blocked and communicated to the user.
